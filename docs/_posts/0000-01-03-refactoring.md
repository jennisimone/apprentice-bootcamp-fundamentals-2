# Boot-camp
## Fundamentals 2
### Day Two

---

# Retro

Note: Retrospect on day one  
  What did you like  
  What didn‚Äôt you like?  

---

# Run all tests at each stage

Note: Observation from yesterday  
  Some of you are running one test each time  
  Run all tests to make sure you don‚Äôt introduce regressions  

---

# Refactoring

-[+] What is it?

Note:
  Explain we are covering refactoring as it‚Äôs part of TDD, and a necessary skill for next exercises 
  Ask for suggestions  

---

> ‚ÄúCode refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code‚Äîchanging the factoring‚Äîwithout changing its external behavior.‚Äù‚ÄîWikipedia

Note: Highlight ‚Äòwithout changing its external behaviour‚Äô  
  Changing nonfunctional properties of the code

---

# Refactoring vs Rewriting

What is the difference?

---

# Rewriting **can** change functionality

Note:
  Term refactoring often used to mean rewriting  
  Just terminology but important to be intentional  
  Rewriting can break functionality  
  Refactoring does not/should not  

---

# Why Refactor?

-[+] Improve maintainability
-[+] Make code easier to read
-[+] Make code easier to change

Note:
  Arguably readability is about maintainability  

---


# Stay green!

<background>green<background/>

-[+] Compilation errors and failing tests are a distraction
-[+] Generally refactoring doesn‚Äôt break tests / syntax
-[+] Less head scratching ten minutes later‚Ä¶

---

# What is a refactor?

Recognised technique by which you change some aspect of the code

---

# For example‚Ä¶

-[+] Rename
-[+] Extract variable
-[+] Extract field
-[+] Extract constant
-[+] Extract method/function
-[+] Inline method/function

---

## You currently do these things manually

(and slowly)

(and the code is broken while you do)

---

# IDE to the rescue

Leverage your IDE (e.g. IntelliJ) to perform the refactor for you
-[+] Safer
-[+] Quicker (once you practice)
-[+] Easier
-[+] Less distracting

Note:
  Explain that the IDE automates manual refactors  
  Renaming a method manually could involve thousands of changes  
  Avoids intermediate compilation failures  
  All this distracts from the functionality you were adding  

---

# Rename

-[+] Your go-to refactor!
-[+] Naming is hard, we get it wrong
-[+] Use it to improve meaning of code
-[+] Rename variables, methods, classes
-[+] Shift + F6 in IntelliJ (your IDE/keymap may vary)

---

# Example

Before:
```java
void scan(String sku) {
    if ("A".equals(sku)) {
```
After:
```java
void scan(String stockKeepingUnit) {
    if ("A".equals(stockKeepingUnit)) {
```

---

# Exercise

Rename all the things

Aim is to get comfortable with the rename refactor

* Do not break ThingyTest
* **ONLY** use rename
  * Ô£ø Mac & Windows: ‚Äò‚áß F6‚Äô
* Try to make it make more sense
* Rename stuff as you try to understand the code

Note:
  More important to get comfortable than finish  
  Ensure screen set up to live code when reviewing  
  IntelliJ in presentation mode on extension display  

---

# Review

* Did you improve the code?
-[+] What did you rename?  
  (live-code the suggestions‚Ä¶)

Note:
  Toggle between extended and mirrored with ‚Äò‚åò F1‚Äô  

---

# Extract Variable

Extract part of a line into a variable (and other duplicate code)

-[+] Split long line of code into meaningful chunks
-[+] Can be used to remove duplication
-[+] Can make the variable name descriptive

---

# Example

Before:
```java
if (numberOfA % 3 == 0) {
    total -= 20;
}
```

After:
```java
final boolean numberOfAIsMultipleOf3 = numberOfA % 3 == 0;
if (numberOfAIsMultipleOf3) {
    total -= 20;
}
```

---

# Exercise

Extract all the variables

Aim is to get comfortable with the extract variable refactor

* Do not break ThingyTest
* **ONLY** use extract variable
  * Ô£ø Mac: ‚Äò‚å• ‚åò V‚Äô (i.e. ‚Äòoption command V‚Äô)
  * Windows: ‚ÄòCtrl Alt V‚Äô
* Try to make it make more sense

---

# Review

* Did you improve the code?
-[+] What variables did you extract?  
  (live-code the suggestions‚Ä¶)

Note:
  Toggle between extended and mirrored with ‚Äò‚åò F1‚Äô  
  Apply refactors as suggested  

---

# Extract Constant

-[+] Remove ‚Äòmagic numbers‚Äô
-[+] Add meaning to values found in the code
-[+] Reduce duplication of values  
  (when they are intended to change at the same time)

---

# Example

Before:
```java
if (numberOfA % 3 == 0) {
    total -= 20;
}
```

After:
```java
if (numberOfA % 3 == 0) {
    total -= DISCOUNT_VALUE_A;
}
```

---

# Exercise

Extract all the constants

Aim is to get comfortable with the extract constant refactor

* Do not break ThingyTest
* **ONLY** use extract constant
  * Ô£ø Mac: ‚Äò‚å• ‚åò C‚Äô (i.e. ‚Äòoption command C‚Äô)
  * Windows: ‚ÄòCtrl Alt C‚Äô
* Try to make it make more sense

---

# Review

* Did you improve the code?
-[+] What constants did you extract?  
  (live-code the suggestions‚Ä¶)

Note: Toggle between extended and mirrored with ‚Äò‚åò F1‚Äô  
  Apply refactors as suggested  
  Make sure you cover the binary / hex numbers,
  booleans for multiples  
  FIZZ, BUZZ etc

---

# Extract Method

-[+] Reduce duplication of blocks of code  

---

# Example

Before:
```java
    if ("A".equals(sku)) {
        numberOfA++;
        if (numberOfA % 3 == 0) {
            total -= 20;
        }
    } else if ("B".equals(sku)) {
        numberOfB++;
        if (numberOfB % 2 == 0) {
            total -= 15;
        }
    }
```

---

# Example

After:
```java
    if ("A".equals(sku)) {
      numberOfA++;
      discount(numberOfA, 3, 20);
    } else if ("B".equals(sku)) {
      numberOfB++;
      discount(numberOfB, 2, 15);
    }
```
```java
  private void discount(int quantity, int offerQuantity, int discount) {
    if (quantity % offerQuantity == 0) {
      total -= discount;
    }
  }

```

# Exercise

Extract some methods

Aim is to get comfortable with the extract method refactor

* Do not break ThingyTest
* **ONLY** use extract method
  * Ô£ø Mac: ‚Äò‚å• ‚åò M‚Äô (i.e. ‚Äòoption command M‚Äô)
  * Windows: ‚ÄòCtrl Alt M‚Äô
* Try to make it make more sense

---

# Review

* Did you improve the code?
-[+] What did you extract?  
  (live-code the suggestions‚Ä¶)

Note: Toggle between extended and mirrored with ‚Äò‚åò F1‚Äô  
  Apply refactors as suggested  

---

# Inline

-[+] Replace a method/variable call with equivalent code
-[+] Opposite of extract method/variable
-[+] Use with caution
-[+] Useful when you want to move code between methods

---

# Example

Before:
```java
final boolean fizz = isFizz();
final boolean buzz = isBuzz();
String word = fizz || buzz ?"":String.valueOf(foo + 1);
if (fizz) word += FIZZ();
if (buzz) word += BUZZ();
```

After:
```java
String word = isFizz() || isBuzz() ?"":String.valueOf(foo + 1);
if (isFizz()) word += FIZZ();
if (isBuzz()) word += BUZZ();
```

---

  private boolean isFizz() {

        countsUp == countsDown;
  }
  ```

Note: This actually broke the tests  
  Careful with your refactors  
  Code can have side effects  
  Need to run tests each time  
  Can fix this but that‚Äôs for another time
