# Why do we test?

Shout out your answers‚Ä¶

-[+] So we know when we are done
-[+] So we know we can make changes safely
-[+] To shorten our feedback loop

---

# Why test first?

Shout out your answers‚Ä¶

-[+] So that we don‚Äôt forget
-[+] So that we can‚Äôt write code that isn‚Äôt testable
-[+] Forces us to think about outcomes
  -[+] It focusses us

---

# Code isn‚Äôt always testable?

-[+] Testable code relies on good design
-[+] ‚ÄòCollaborators‚Äô need to be exposed
-[+] Results need to be predictable
-[+] Need to have granular access to produce useful failures

---

## Why don‚Äôt people test first?

Shout out your answers‚Ä¶

-[+] Code is hard to test
-[+] They are exploring
-[+] Lack of necessary skill set
  -[+] Might not be comfortable writing test without understanding implementation
-[+] Lack of appropriate motivation
-[+] No exposure to culture where testing seen as valuable
-[+] Code is disposable

---

# Unit tests

Unit of what?

-[+] One method?
-[+] One class?
-[+] One clump?
-[+] One piece of knowledge üëç

### Other levels of test are available

               /\                                      
              /  \

Note: Mention integration tests, system tests, refer to later boot camp on testing triangle

# Test Organisation

This matters

-[+] Tests should be cohesive
-[+] Tests should be clean
  -[+] Use arrange, act, assert as test case structure
  -[+] Make the test case talk
  -[+] Scenario should be limited to salient points

---

# Arrange, Act, Assert

```java
    @Test
    public void oneOfEach() {
        // Arrange
        Checkout checkout = new Checkout();
        checkout.scan("A");
        checkout.scan("B");
        checkout.scan("C");
        // Act
        String receipt = checkout.receipt();
        // Assert
        assertThat(receipt).containsSequence(
                "A: 50\n",
                "B: 30\n",
                "C: 20\n",
                "Total: 100");
    }
```

Note: Helps us to see what is being tested  
  From Bill Wake
  Matches with Specification By Example, Given, When, Then from Behaviour-Driven Development and Four Phase Test from Gerard Meszaros  

---

## Noisy Test

```java
@Test
public void canFindHealthCheckLocation() {
  String clusterId = "cluster-id";
  String healthCheck = "/health-check";
  Environment environment = testEnvironment()
    .withRelease(release("release-id")
      .withStack(stack("stack-id")
        .withClusters(cluster(clusterId)
          .withType(type("test-type"))
          .withLabel("cluster-label")
          .withHealthCheck(healthCheck)))).build();

  assertThat(environment.healthCheckForCluster(clusterId))
    .isEqualTo(healthCheck);
}
```

---

## Clean(er) Test

```java
@Test
public void canFindHealthCheckLocation() {
  // Arrange
  String clusterId = "cluster-id";
  String healthCheck = "/health-check";
  Environment environment = testEnvironment()
    .withHealthCheckForCluster(healthCheck, clusterId).build();
  // Act
  HealthCheck healthCheckForCluster = 
    environment.healthCheckForCluster(clusterId);
  // Assert
  assertThat(healthCheckForCluster)
    .isEqualTo(healthCheck);
}
```

-[+] Write enough test to make it fail meaningfully
-[+] Write just enough code to make it pass
-[+] Improve code you‚Äôve touched which needs tidying

Note: Start by discussing what to test  
  Acknowledge we haven‚Äôt covered refactoring yet    

---

## Why Red, Green, Refactor?

-[+] Failing first means we know our test is working
-[+] Seeing a meaningful failure checks the test quality
-[+] Only writing enough code to make it pass ensures coverage
-[+] Refactoring means the design doesn‚Äôt degrade over time
-[+] Keeping the cycle short means we know why our test is failing
-[+] Also don‚Äôt have to maintain large contexts

Note: Explain meaningful failure  
  Good design doesn‚Äôt happen magically  
  Can only focus on a few things at once‚Äîcognitive load theory  

---

# Meaningless failure

```
java.lang.AssertionError
	at checkout.CheckoutTests.twoA(CheckoutTests.java:24)

Process finished with exit code 255
```

-[+] No knowledge expressed
-[+] Can‚Äôt see values being compared

Note: Ask what is wrong  

---

# Meaning<mark>ful</mark> failure

```
org.junit.ComparisonFailure: [2 ‚ÄòA‚Äôs must cost 100] 
Expected :100
Actual   :130
 <Click to see difference>
 
 at checkout.CheckoutTests.twoA(CheckoutTests.java:24)

Process finished with exit code 255
```

-[+] Helpful message
-[+] Values displayed
-[+] Can see more detailed breakdown

### Exercise: [Bowling kata](http://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/) (1 hour)

In pairs, write code to calculate the ***total*** score for a valid sequence of rolls of American Ten-Pin Bowling. Don‚Äôt check for valid rolls, correct number of rolls/frames.

* 10 frames (usually two rolls in each)
* If a ***spare*** (all pins knocked over in two rolls), the value of the first roll of the next frame is doubled
  * In final frame, extend the frame by one bonus ball
* If a ***strike*** (all pins knocked over in one roll), frame finishes and value of the next frame is doubled
  * In final frame, extend the frame by two bonus balls

Note: Mentors to guide the TDD process

## Retro/stand-up

-[+] Who found it hard?
-[+] Was it hard to follow the Red/Green/Refactor cycle? Why?
-[+] How many tests did you write / how many cycles?
-[+] What was your first test?
-[+] Who wrote code without a failing test?

Note: If there‚Äôs extra time‚Ä¶  
  Do the checkout kata with red green refactor (1 hour)

## Exercise: Highly Realistic Business Scenario

Remember the business example from boot camp one?

-[+] Extract requirements
-[+] Write some code

---

We want you to extract a handful of requirements around how to generate the customer bills from this description

<font size=3 align='left'>

<p>
Auto Trader is an organisation which advertises both new and used vehicles for sale.
Vehicles are advertised by both private individuals and dealers, and can be of many
different types, including cars, motorbikes and vans.
An advert, as displayed on the website, includes a price, a description, a make, a model and a registration.
</p>

<p>
In order to bill a customer for placing an advert their name and address must be stored.
Customers have the option of buying additional products to improve the quality of their adverts.
</p>

<p>
For example there is a product which changes the appearance of the advert to make it stand-out in the
search results by giving it a different background colour.
</p>

<p>
Any given vehicle can appear on multiple adverts, as they are also hosted on third-party websites
such as those run by car dealerships as well as other businesses.
</p>

<p>
All customers (dealers and private individuals) are billed every month. The costs are different for dealers and private individuals, but bills depend on how many adverts and products the customers are using.
</p>

</font>

* Aim for around 3‚Äì5 separate things
* Think a little about what you can do first

# Review

How did you split up the requirements?

---

### Here‚Äôs some we made earlier

<font size=5 align='left'>

<p>
**As a** dealer  
**I want** to be able to pay for a fixed rate stock level  
**So that** I can budget for my advertising expenditure  
</p>

<p>
**As a** dealer  
**I want** to be able to promote my adverts for a month  
**So that** I can stand out from my competitors when necessary  
</p>

<p>
**As a** private car seller  
**I want** to be able to place an advert for my vehicle for a monthly fee  
**So that** I can sell my vehicle  
</p>

<p>
**As a** private car seller  
**I want** to be able to promote my advert for a month  
**So that** I can sell my vehicle more quickly  
</p>

Part Two: Calculate a bill for each of these customers

|Customer|Type|Adverts|Products|
|-|-|-|
|Arthur‚Äôs Cars|Dealer|20|Advert promotion|
|Super Car Market|Dealer|1000|Finance, Valuations|
|Derek|Private|3|none|
|Sarah|Private|1|100 images|

* Each product costs ¬£10/advert/month
* Adverts cost ¬£50/month for dealers, and ¬£20/month for private individuals
